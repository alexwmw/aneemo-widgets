    Reflective Exercise:
    <span class="subheading">What Are My Concerns?</span>
  </h1>
  <div class="ws-body" id="ws-body">
    <p>
      What are your main concerns at the moment? Which of them do you have
      influence and control over? Are you focusing too much on your circle of
      concern, and not enough on your circle of influence?
      <strong>Try the exercise below.</strong> Start to shift the balance back
      towards your circle of influence.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Take a minute to write down in the box below as many things as you are
        currently concerned about</strong
      >. This could be within a particular domain – for example, at work or in
      your career – or they could be more general concerns. Try to be as
      specific as possible.
